# JobSystem reborn development(2019.8.26-2019.9.10)
## waiting mechanism(2019.8.26-2019.9.10)
- goal there was waiting mechanism, so worker threads can busy wait/find jobs all the time which will make the cpu 100% occupied
- tmp plan: need a global condition_variable for waiting, but what about private list? portable solution for waiting on 2 locks/cv?
	- solve: global condition_variable, global available job count, do not allow lock job to worker thread

# balance job insertion based on existing jobs(2019.9.10-2019.9.11)
- use very vanilla algorithm: capture all queue loads, do perfect balancing
# VS2019(2019.9.13-2019.9.14)
- generate vs2019 project file(abandon vs2017), and -Wall
# IncludeOrganizer(2019.9.15-2019.9.15)
- rearrange includes

# transfer the whole engine to use jobsystem(2019.9.15-?)
- FrameLogicModule
	- how to express timeline
	- timeline is not straight enough, data flow is! Data driven design
	- sort of like frame module and gpu pass oraganization
	- why explicit loop body is bad: it forbids module level parallization
- TimerModule
- MainThread
- RenderThread
- elegent quit
