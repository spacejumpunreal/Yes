# JobSystem reborn development(2019.8.26-2019.9.10)
## waiting mechanism(2019.8.26-2019.9.10)
- goal there was waiting mechanism, so worker threads can busy wait/find jobs all the time which will make the cpu 100% occupied
- tmp plan: need a global condition_variable for waiting, but what about private list? portable solution for waiting on 2 locks/cv?
	- solve: global condition_variable, global available job count, do not allow lock job to worker thread

# balance job insertion based on existing jobs(2019.9.10-2019.9.11)
- use very vanilla algorithm: capture all queue loads, do perfect balancing
# VS2019

# transfer the whole engine to use jobsystem(?-?)
- MainThread
- RenderThread

# Vulkan

# SWR
