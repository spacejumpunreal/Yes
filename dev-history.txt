# JobSystem reborn development(2019.8.26-?)
## waiting mechanism(2019.8.26-?)
- goal there was waiting mechanism, so worker threads can busy wait/find jobs all the time which will make the cpu 100% occupied
- tmp plan: need a global condition_variable for waiting, but what about private list? portable solution for waiting on 2 locks/cv?
