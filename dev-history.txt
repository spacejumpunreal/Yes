# JobSystem reborn development(2019.8.26-2019.9.10)
## waiting mechanism(2019.8.26-2019.9.10)
- goal there was waiting mechanism, so worker threads can busy wait/find jobs all the time which will make the cpu 100% occupied
- tmp plan: need a global condition_variable for waiting, but what about private list? portable solution for waiting on 2 locks/cv?

# transfer the whole engine to use jobsystem(2019.9.10-?)
- MainThread
- RenderThread

# Vulkan

# SWR
